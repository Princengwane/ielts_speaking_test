# IELTS Speaking Test Simulation
Overview
The IELTS Speaking Test Simulation is a tool designed to help users practice for the IELTS speaking test by simulating a real-time speaking test experience. The tool allows users to converse with an AI-powered IELTS examiner, receive instant feedback on their responses, and track their progress through detailed PDF reports. The system evaluates responses based on IELTS criteria, including fluency, pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary.

Key Features:
Real-Time Speech-to-Text: Converts user speech into text in real-time using Google Cloud's Speech-to-Text API.
Conversational AI: Simulates responses from an IELTS examiner using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.
Feedback System: Provides instant feedback on grammar, fluency, and vocabulary with suggestions for improvement.
IELTS Scoring Simulation: Calculates basic IELTS scores for grammar and fluency based on user input.
PDF Report Generation: After each session, users can download a personalized PDF report summarizing their performance and feedback.
System Architecture
1. Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript):
The frontend is a simple web interface that allows users to start and stop recording, view conversation logs, and download performance reports.
2. Backend (Flask):
The backend, powered by Flask, handles user interactions and communication with external APIs for speech-to-text conversion, AI conversation generation, and PDF report creation.
Key Routes:
/: Main webpage to start the IELTS test simulation.
/process_audio: Processes the user’s audio input, converts it to text, generates examiner responses, and calculates feedback.
/download_pdf: Generates and allows users to download a PDF report of their performance.
3. External APIs:
Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API: Converts audio input into text, enabling real-time speech recognition.
OpenAI GPT-4: Simulates an IELTS examiner’s conversational response based on the user’s transcribed input.
ReportLab: Used to generate a PDF report with the conversation and feedback.
Usage
Practice Mode: Start recording and practice conversational English. Receive instant feedback for each response.
Test Mode: Simulate a full IELTS speaking test, with 3 parts (Introduction, Long Turn, and Two-Way Discussion). At the end, receive a detailed PDF report.
PDF Report
At the end of the session, users can download a PDF report containing:

User’s input and examiner responses.
Scores for grammar, fluency, and other criteria.
Feedback with suggestions for improvement.
Future Enhancements
Advanced Fluency Scoring: Incorporate pauses, sentence structure, and coherence to assess fluency more accurately.
Multi-Language Support: Enable feedback and test simulation in multiple languages.
User Progress Tracking: Implement a system to track progress across multiple sessions.
Pronunciation Feedback: Analyze user pronunciation with phoneme-level feedback.
